      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Devin Hopkins-Baker. I was born in Hamilton, Ontario on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of April. I was born to my mother Dyane, and my father, Andrew. Growing up I lived on a street named Summerhill Avenue. I went to an elementary school called "St.Euegenes" from grades 1 to 8. After that I went to a highschool called Bishop Ryan <abbr title="Catholic Secondary School">CSS</abbr>. Through high school I was interested in classes like personal fitness, history and philosophy. I struggled more in classes like math, physics and biology. Growing up I had a dog named Maxy. He was a little yorkshire terrier that my mother got for my sister and I after the goldfish just weren't cutting it anymore. Later on we got a little puppy named Lola who is Maxy's daughter. Sadly, Maxy passed away but Lola is still around and my mother's favorite child by far.</p>

      <h3>Post Secondary</h3>
      <p>Out of highschool I was never sure what I waned to take in post secondary. I started an <abbr title="Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning">HVAC</abbr> program at mohawk college in Hamilton but it wasn't for me. Then I took time during covid to work and save up some money for school. I worked in a conservation area as a lead hand and equipment operator. I loved that job because I really enjoy being in nature. Last summer I visited my best friend in Ottawa who had been attending Carleton University in computer engineering. After thoroughly enjoying my time in the city and getting to learn more about what he was studying I was inclined to look into programs at <em>Algonquin College</em>. The <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course peaked my interest as I wanted to learn more about computers and be creative at the same time. That has lead me to now be living in Ottawa with my best friend and attending Algonquin. So far I am very happy with my choices! </p>
